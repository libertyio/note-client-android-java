Liberty Note for Android
========================

A simple note-taking application that connects with Liberty Note service
and uses LoginShield for authentication.

This is a work in progress. It is currently usable in conjunction with
the free note service at https://liberty.io but this should be considered
an alpha quality service.

Features:

* create a new note
* edit an existing note
* delete an existing note
* synchronize notes with server
* login with LoginShield

IMPORTANT PRIVACY NOTICE: the notes are currently NOT encrypted; they are
stored on the server in plain text. Do not store any sensitive information
using this application.
